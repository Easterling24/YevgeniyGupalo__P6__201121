Photography oriented platform presenting a list of available photographers and then providing 
more details regarding its work on the detailed page.

From starting point, the user can either filter the available elements(photographers) based on tags displayed in the header section.
Then user can simply click on one of the cards, hence redirected to photographer’s detailed profile displaying his work/portfolio, contact option,
ability to give a like beneath each media.

Accessibility feature is key for this project, therefore it’s possible to navigate throughout the pages using "TAB" and "TAB + Shift". 
The user will notice on which element he is currently being positioned; a focus area will appear to indicate the currently visited element.
The arrow keys can be used to navigate between lightbox media aka images/videos.
